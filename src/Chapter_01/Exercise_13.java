/*
    (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations)
    You can use Cramerâ€™s rule to solve the following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
    ax + by = e
    cx + dy = f
    x = (ed - bf)/(ad - bc)
    y = (af - ec)/(ad - bc)
    Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
    3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
    2.1x + 0.55y = 5.9
